Character drivers
=================

The syntax of a character driver specification is:

<driver>:<option1>=<value1>:<option2>=<value2>...

White space around option names and values is ignored. If a value contains
a colon, it must be escaped by repeating it.


The following is a list of character drivers and their options:

mouse:
	A serial mouse. If more than one mouse is configured, all mice
	will report the same movements and button presses.

	protocol=<proto>
		Set the mouse protocol. Valid values are:

		microsoft
			A Microsoft two button serial mouse.

		msys
			A Mouse Systems three button serial mouse.

		The default is "ms".

	xmul=<int>
	ydiv=<int>
		The horizontal mouse speed is multiplied by (xmul / xdiv).

	ymul=<int>
	ydiv=<int>
		The vertical mouse speed is multiplied by (ymul / ydiv).

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.

null:
	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.

posix:
	The "read" and "write" options are used only if "file" is not
	set.

	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	file=<filename>
		Set the input and output file name.

	file=-
		Read input from stdin, write output to stdout.

	file=--
		Read input from stdin, write output to stderr.

	read=<filename>
		Set the input file name.

	read=-
		Read input from stdin.

	write=<filename>
		Set the output file name.

	write=-
		Write output to stdout.

	write=--
		Write output to stderr.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.


ppp:
	For this driver to work, tun/tap support must be enabled.

	if=<name>
		Set the tun/tap interface name, for example "tun0".

	host-ip=<ip-addr>
		Set the host side IP address.

	guest-ip=<ip-addr>
		Set the guest side IP address.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.


pty:
	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	symlink=<filename>
		Create a symlink pointing to the new pseudo terminal device.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.


slip:
	For this driver to work, tun/tap support must be enabled.

	if=<name>
		Set the tun/tap interface name, for example "tun0".


stdio:
	Output is written to a file. No input is ever provided.

	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	file=<filename>
		Set the output file name.

	file=-
		Use standard output as output.

	flush=[0|1]
		If true, flush the output file whenever data is written.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.


tcp:
	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	connect=[0|1]
		If true, initiate a connection to the host and port
		specified in the host and port options. Otherwise
		wait for connections to the port specified in the
		port option.

	host=<hostname>
		Set the host name to connect to if connect is true.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.

	port=<port>
		Set the TCP port number.

	telnet=[0|1]
		If true, will handle option negotiation for telnet
		binary and character mode. Useful when the serial
		line is a tty, to provide proper terminal emulation.

	telnetinit=[0|1]
		If this and "telnet" are true, initiate telnet option
		negotiations immediately after accepting a connection.
		Common telnet clients need this when connecting to
		a port other than 23. Defaults to true.

	usectl=[0|1]
		If true, modem status lines are properly handled in
		both directions. Specifically, DSR is always asserted,
		CTS and CD are only asserted when a client is
		connected to the TCP port, and flashing DTR causes the
		TCP connection to close. This is useful when the
		serial line is a tty, to close the connection when
		logged out and, conversely, to log out when the
		connection is closed manually. Defaults to true.

tios:
	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	file=<filename>
		The character device to connect to

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name

wincom:
	Windows COM port support. This driver is only available under
	Windows.

	cap=<filename>
		Set the capture file name.

	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.

	port=<port>
		Set the windows COM port to use, for example "COM1" or
		"COM2".
