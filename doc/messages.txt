PCE Messages
==============================================================================

Messages are used to control the emulator. They can be sent using the "m"
command in the monitor, for example

-m emu.disk.eject 0

will eject the first floppy disk. Message prefixes can be omitted, as long
as the message name is unambiguous (except where noted). The following
commands are equivalent:

-m disk.eject 0
-m eject 0

A message has at most one parameter. If the parameter contains spaces, it
must be enclosed in double quotes in the monitor, like this:

-m term.screenshot "my screenshot.ppm"
