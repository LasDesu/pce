.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpfi\fR(1) is used to modify and convert PFI flux image files.

.SH OPTIONS

.BI "-c, --cylinder " "cyl1[-cyl2]"
Select a range of cylinders. To select all cylinders, specify
\fBall\fR as parameter.
\
.TP
.B "-f, --info"
Print information about the current image or the next image loaded.
\
.TP
.BI "-h, --head " "head1[-head2]"
Select a range of heads. To select all heads, specify
\fBall\fR as parameter.
\
.TP
.BI "-i, --input " filename
Load an image from \fIfilename\fR.
\
.TP
.BI "-I, --input-format " format
Set the file format for the next input file. If this option is not
used, the file format is detected automatically.

Valid formats are:
.RS
.TP
.B pfi
The native PFI format
.TP
.B scp
Supercard Pro flux image
.TP
.B raw
Kryoflux raw stream
.RE
\
.TP
.B "-l, --list-short"
List all tracks in the current image, one line per track.
\
.TP
.B "-L, --list-long"
List all tracks in the current image, one line per revolution.
\
.TP
.BI "-o, --output " filename
Set the output file name. Before exiting, the current image will
be written to this file.
\
.TP
.BI "-O, --output-format " format
Set the output file format. If this option is not used, the file
format is determined by the output file name.

Valid formats are:
.RS
.TP
.B pfi
The native PFI format
.TP
.B scp
Supercard Pro flux image
.RE
\
.TP
.BI "-p, --operation " "name [arg...]"
Perform an operation on the current image. Valid operations are:
.RS
.TP
.BI "comment-add " text
Add \fItext\fR to the image comment.
.TP
.BI "comment-load " filename
Load the image comment from file \fIfilename\fR.
.TP
.B comment-print
Print the current image comment.
.TP
.BI "comment-save " filename
Save the current image comment to \fIfilename\fR.
.TP
.BI "comment-set " text
Set the image comment to \fItext\fR.
.TP
.BI "decode " "type filename"
Decode the image and save it to \fIfilename\fR.

Valid decode types are:
.RS
.TP
.B pri
Save the decoded image as a PRI image.
.TP
.B pri-mac
Save the decoded image as a PRI image. This decode type also overrides
the bitrate set with the \fB-r\fR option with the apporpriate variable
bitrates used by Macintosh double density disk drives.
.RE
.TP
.B "delete"
Delete the selected tracks.
.TP
.B "double-step"
Remove odd numbered tracks.
.TP
.B "double-step-even"
Remove even numbered tracks.
.TP
.BI "encode " "type filename"
Load an image from \fIfilename\fR and encode it.

Valid encode types are:
.RS
.TP
.B pri
Encode a PRI image
.RE
.TP
.B "info"
Print information about the image.
.TP
.BI "revolutions " "rev1[-rev2]"
Extract revolutions \fIrev1\fR to \fIrev2\fR on all selected tracks.
Revolutions not within the selected range are deleted.
.TP
.BI "scale " "factor"
Multiply the pulse widths on all selected tracks by \fIfactor\fR. This
has the same effect as dividing the rotational speed by \fIfactor\fR.
.TP
.BI "set-clock " "clock"
Set the clock rate to \fIclock\fR.
.TP
.BI "set-rpm " "rpm"
Adjust the rotational speed of all selected tracks to \fIrpm\fR
revolutions per minute by scaling the pulse widths by a constant
factor.
.TP
.BI "shift-index " "offset"
Add \fIoffset\fR clock cycles to all index positions, thereby rotating
the track data relative to the index.
.TP
.BI "slack " percentage
Limit the slack data before the first and after the last index to at
most \fIpercentage\fR percent of a full revolution.
.RE
\
.TP
.BI "-r, --data-rate " rate
Set the bit rate that is used to decode the image. The default is
500000 bits per second.
\
.TP
.BI "-R, --revolution " rev
Use revolution number \fIrev\fR when decoding. The first revolution is
number 1.
\
.TP
.BI "-s, --set " "par val"
Set parameter \fIpar\fR to \fIval\fR.
.RS
.TP
.BI "clock-tolerance " val
Set the clock tolerance in tenth of a percent. The default is 40. If
during decoding the data rate changes by more than the tolerance, a
clock event is recorded in the PRI file.
.TP
.BI "fold-max " bits
When folding tracks, compare at most \fIbits\fR bits. The default is
16384.
.TP
.BI "fold-mode " mode
Set the track fold mode to \fImode\fR. Valid modes are:
.RS
.TP
.B none
Fold the track at the index pulse.
.TP
.B maxrun
Fold the track at the bit position that results in the longest run of
identical bits at the beginning of the two revolutions. This is the
default mode.
.TP
.B mindiff
Fold the track at the bit position that results in the fewest differences
between the two revolutions.
.RE
.TP
.B pfi-clock
Set the clock rate that is used to encode images. The default is
24027428.
.TP
.B slack1
When extracting revolutions using the \fBrevolutions\fR operation include
this much slack space before the first index. The value specifies a percentage
of a complete revolution. The default is 10.
.TP
.B slack2
The amount of slack space after the last index. The default is 10.
.TP
.BI "weak-bits " "val"
If \fIval\fR is non-zero enable weak bit detection when decoding to PRI.
.RE
\
.TP
.BI "-t, --track " "c h"
Select a range of tracks. This is equivalent to "\fB-c\fR \fIc\fR \fB-h\fR \fIh\fR".
\
.TP
.B "-v, --verbose"
Enable verbose operation.
\
.TP
.B "-z, --clear"
Clear the track selection.
\
.TP
.B --help
Print usage information.
\
.TP
.B --version
Print version information.
