.SH EXAMPLES
Convert an ImageDisk file to a PSI file:
.IP ""
$ psi source.imd dest.psi
.PP
Get image information:
.IP
$ psi -f image.psi
.PP
Add sectors 10 and 11 to all tracks on side 0:
.IP
$ psi -i source.psi -r all 0 10-11 -p new -o dest.psi
.PP
Mark the first sector in the image as having a bad data CRC:
.IP
$ psi -i source.psi -r 0 0 1 -e crc-data 1 -o dest.psi
.PP
Set the image comment:
.IP
$ psi -i source.psi -p comment-set "Test image" -o dest.psi
